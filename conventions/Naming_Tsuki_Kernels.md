# Conventions for naming Tsuki kernels.
Tsuki kernels should be named after dieties, and the dieties names should have more than one syllable. Names should be latinized if they are in a non-latin based alphabet (Such as Cyrillic). Names are only changed after "Major" releases. This means any kernel where a significant enough change has taken place, but does not always mean a change of the Major version number. The kernels will be named in alphabetical order, looping back to A once past Z.

## Version history
* **Tsuki Kernel 1.0** - TBA
