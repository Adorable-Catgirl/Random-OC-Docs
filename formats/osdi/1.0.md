## More about flags
### 0x000200 - Active
This is exactly like the MBR "active" flag. If the bootcode partition is marked as active, it should be executed, otherwise, load the first two sectors.

### 0x000040 - Zorya special value
Only a Zorya bootloader partition should have this!

### 0x000080 - Managed FS emulation
This value is set if the FS should emulate a managed FS. Only works if supported.

### 0x000C00 - OEFI hint mask
This value gives an OEFIv2.1+ compliant BIOS a "hint" as to what the partition may contain.

| Hint value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Blacklist |
| 1 | Whitelist, has OEFI applications |
| 2 | Contains OEFI-FS driver code |
| 3 | OEFI bootloader |
