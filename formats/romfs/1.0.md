# romfs, Version 1.0
romfs is a small, simple archive format.

## Entry layout
| Field | Type | Sample |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name Size | `uint8_t` | `4` |
| Name | *(string)* | `test` |
| File size | `uint16_t` | `11` |
| File mode | *(character)* | `-` |
| File Data | *(data)* | `hello world` |

## File modes
The default file mode is `-`. This represents a non-executable file. `x` represents an executable file. If an entry with a non-standard mode is found, a program should ignore it.

## Directories
This standard does not lay out any way for directories to exist. Instead, directories are recorded in the name of a file (ie `bin/sh.lua`).

## Reading a romfs file
A romfs file should be read like a CPIO file, reading entries until you read an entry with the name `TRAILER!!!`. If a program reaches the end of file without finding the `TRAILER!!!` entry, it should raise a warning, if not an error.

## Limits
Paths are limited to 255 bytes in length, and files are limited to 64KiB in size.
