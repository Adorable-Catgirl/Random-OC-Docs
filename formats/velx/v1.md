## VELX Header
Note: Fields are little endian.
```c
struct velx_header {
	char magic[5];
	uint8_t file_version;
	uint8_t compression;
	uint8_t lua_version;
	uint8_t os_id;
	char arctype[4];
	uint24_t program_size;
	uint24_t osdep_section;
	uint24_t signature_size;
	uint32_t archive_size;
};
```
* Version is 0 in the current version.
* No archive has a type of all 0s.
* Empty sections should have a size of 0.
* Magic value is `\27VelX`
* Highest bit os OS ID tells if binary is a library or not (msb = 1 means library)
* Lua (un)pack string is `<c5BBBBc4I3I3I3I4`

### Compression methods
Compression only applies to program section.

## Other fields
Everything else is up to you. The OS dependant section may be used for whatever you desire. Bring your own archive.

## Reading
Directly after the header comes the program section. After the program section comes the OS dependant section, then the signature section, and then the archive section. Use the sizes you obtained from the header.
