# VELX Version 2

## VELX Main Header
Note: Fields *should* be little endian, but check the endian field.

```c
struct v2_headmain {
  char magic[5];
  uint8_t version;
  uint16_t endian_check; // 0xAA55
  uint64_t checksum;
  uint64_t flags;
  uint64_t main_offset;
  uint16_t section_count;
  uint8_t binary_type;
};
```

* Version 2 is the current version
* Flags are reserved for later use. If any flags are specified, fail.
* Checksum is updated for every byte read after the header.
* Checksum type is xxHash64

### Binary Types

| ID | Binary type |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Object |
| 1 | Library |
| 2 | Executable |
| 3 | Driver |

## VELX Section header

```c
struct v2_sectheader {
	uint64_t checksum;
	uint64_t size;
	uint64_t offset;
	uint64_t flags;
	uint32_t osid;
	uint16_t tag_count;
	uint16_t align;
	uint8_t name_length;
};
```

* Checksum is updated for every byte in the section after the name.
* The 32 most significant bits of the flag are application reserved.
* Offset is relative to the main offset.

### Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00000001 | Fill memory with 0. Used for bss. |

### OS IDs

All IDs from VELXv1 are to be reserved in VELXv2, except that ID == 0 is all. (Mainly used for archives)

## Tags
```c
struct v2_tagdef {
	uint8_t keylen;
	uint8_t valuelen;
};
```

### Tag type definition
There are a number of different "tag type definitions", which are prefixes to the key. The format for this is `type:key`. Untyped keys are assumed to be byte arrays. Unknown types should be treated as byte arrays. Custom types are OK.

| Tag Type | Type |
| --- | --- |
| str | String, utf-8 |
| u8 | Unsigned 8-bit integer |
| u16 | Unsigned 16-bit integer, file endian |
| u32 | Unsigned 32-bit integer, file endian |
| u64 | Unsigned 64-bit integer, file endian |
| i8 | Signed 8-bit integer, two's component |
| i16 | Signed 16-bit integer, file endian, two's component |
| i32 | Signed 32-bit integer, file endian, two's component |
| i64 | Signed 64-bit integer, file endian, two's component |
| bool | Boolean, single byte, x > 0 |
| f32 | IEEE 754 Single Precision, file endian |
| f64 | IEEE 754 Double Precision, file endian |

## Reserved sections

### `text` - Native code
TODO: Fill out

### `gst` - Global Symbol Table
TODO: Fill out

### `got` - Global Offset Table
Think ELF

### `lua` - Lua code
`str:version` may specify a minimum Lua version (major.minor.patch)

### `sig` - Signature
`str:type` may specify a type

### `arc` - Archive
`str:type` may specify a type
