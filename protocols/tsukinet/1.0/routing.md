# Routing
Routing in Tsukinet is done in two ways: Passive and active.

## Passively mapping TN addresses to H/W addresses
One can listen for shouted packets and use those to match the TN sender address with the H/W address. You can also discover such when being whispered to.

## Actively mapping
One can use lookup ARP requests for the same thing.
